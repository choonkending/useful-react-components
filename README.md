# Useful React Components

A collection of useful react components - that can be reused across projects.

Mainly examples of how it should be done, but if it can be abstracted, it *might*
be worth making it a npm module.

## Instructions
```bash
npm install
npm start
// Go to localhost:3000
```

:v: Enjoy
